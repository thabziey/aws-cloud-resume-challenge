# My AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

[What is Cloud Resume Challenge?](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/)


## About The Project
Here's my journey through the Cloud Resume Challenge in AWS. This challenge provided a structured approach to building a full-stack application that serves as both a resume and a demonstration of cloud skills. 

The challenge breakdown:
- Frontend Development: Built a static website using HTML and CSS to showcase my resume.
- Cloud Deployment: Hosted the resume on Amazon S3 and implemented HTTPS using CloudFront. Then set up a Custom Domain with Route 53.
- Backend Development: Implemented a visitor counter using JavaScript, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to track visitors.
- DevOps Automation: Utilized Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool Terraform, implemented source control with GitHub, and set up CI/CD pipelines.
